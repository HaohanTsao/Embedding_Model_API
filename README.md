# Embedding_Model_API

This project involves building and deploying a cloud function that receives webhook requests from Supabase. It extracts the necessary information, such as the post_id, content, and title. And it generates an embedding for the post. Subsequently, both the post_id and its corresponding embedding are stored in the assigned table.
